## Professional Statement
My name is Goran Solev. I am a disciplined, analytical professional with a strong drive to build a career in cybersecurity. I thrive on solving complex problems, mastering new technologies, and bringing order to challenging situations – skills I have honed in logistics and now apply to digital defence.

I am scheduled to take the **(ISC)² Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)** exam next week and am actively progressing through the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**. I study consistently every week, complete hands-on labs on TryHackMe, and document all projects on GitHub.

I am passionate about protecting organisations through proactive threat detection, log analysis, and incident response. My immediate goal is to secure an **entry-level SOC Analyst or Junior Cybersecurity Analyst role in the UK** within the next 6–9 months. This certificate will provide the practical networking, Linux, SIEM, and response skills employers demand, enabling me to deliver real value from Day 1 and grow into a trusted cybersecurity professional.
